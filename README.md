This is a simple version of John Conway's <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> in python. When run, the user will be asked to choose the size of the grid, number of iterations (generations), seed pattern, and starting x and y coordinates. Requires numpy and matplotlib's animation and pyplot libraries.
