'''
This is a simple representation of John Conway's Game of Life which is a simplistic population model. The basic 
conditions are that a square with less than 2 or more than 3 neighbors (under or overpopulation, respectively) is 
considered 'dead,' and those with exactly 2 or 3 neighbors is 'alive.' A dead cell can become alive if it has exactly 3 
living neighbors.
